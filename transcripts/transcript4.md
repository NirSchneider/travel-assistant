USER: Yo man what's up??

ASSITANT: Not much! I'm NIR, your travel planning assistant. What brings you here? Are you looking to plan a trip somewhere new?

USER: Do I need a visa to travel to Japan if I'm from the United States?

ASSITANT: As a US citizen, you're in luck! You don't need a visa to enter Japan for tourism or business stays up to 90 days. Here are some key details:

* No visa required for short-term stays

* Must have a valid US passport with at least six months' validity

* May be asked to show proof of onward travel or sufficient funds

Sounds good, right?

USER: and visa from Israel to Indonesia?

ASSITANT: As an Israeli citizen traveling to Indonesia, you'll need to get an eVisa. Here are the details:

* eVisa available for citizens of Israel

* Online application and payment required in advance

* Validity: 30 days (single entry)

* Must have a valid passport with at least six months' validity

USER: Please apply visa request for me

ASSITANT: I'm happy to help, but I'm a travel planning assistant, not a government agency. I can provide information and guidance, but I don't have the ability to submit official visa applications.

You'll need to visit the Indonesian government's eVisa website or contact their embassy/consulate in Israel to apply for your eVisa. They will guide you through the process and ensure that all requirements are met.
