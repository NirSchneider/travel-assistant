USER: What should I pack for a trip to Tokyo in March?

ASSITANT: 

Tokyo in March can be quite lovely! Here's what you might want to consider packing:

• Lightweight rain jacket or umbrella (spring showers are common)

• Comfortable walking shoes (you'll likely do a lot of exploring on foot)

• Layers for cooler mornings and evenings (average highs around 12°C/54°F, lows around 6°C/43°F)

• Power adapter for Japan (Type A)

• Small cross-cultural guidebook or phrasebook (helpful for navigating the city)

How long are you planning to stay in Tokyo?

USER: I'll be there for 10 days. What about formal wear?

ASSITANT: For a 10-day trip, you can likely get by with one or two nicer outfits for dinner at a restaurant or special event.

• One or two dressier tops or blouses

• A pair of nice slacks or a skirt (optional)

• Dress shoes or nice boots

Keep in mind that Tokyo is generally quite casual, so you don't need to pack formal wear for everyday activities. What's your main reason for visiting Tokyo?

USER: What's the weather going to be like?

ASSITANT: March can be a bit unpredictable in Tokyo, but here's what you can expect:

• Temperatures: Daytime highs around 12°C (54°F), nighttime lows around 6°C (43°F)

• Rainfall: March is still part of Japan's wet season, with an average of 10 rainy days throughout the month

• Sunshine: Expect about 5-6 hours of direct sunshine per day

It's a good idea to pack layers for cooler mornings and evenings, as well as a waterproof jacket or umbrella.
